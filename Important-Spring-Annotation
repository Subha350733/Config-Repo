@SpringBootApplication : < Component -> Spring Boot >

      Starting point of any Spring Boot Application .
      
      The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @SpringBootConfiguration, 
      @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan with their default attributes

      @EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism
      @ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located
      @SpringBootConfiguration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes

@RestController : < Component -> Spring WEB >

      Mark any class as a REST Controller

      Spring 4.0 introduced the @RestController annotation in order to simplify the creation of RESTful web services. 
      It's a convenient annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, 
      which eliminates the need to annotate every request handling method of the controller class with the @ResponseBody annotation.
